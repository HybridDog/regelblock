Firstly, thanks for making the decision to use the regelblock mod.
Preparation:
	Take a screenshot of the server rules posted e.g. at a forum topic.
		Note: To make the rules fit into a square, change the window size of the web browser.
	Then cut the screenshot, e.g. by using gimp, and optimize the result.
	After that, put the screenshot into regelblock/textures/,
	delete the file regelblock.png and
	name the screenshot regelblock.png.
Ingame:
	Get the node by using /giveme regelblock:block.
	Place the node that players can easily read the rules.
	Put a strong light source, e.g. moreblocks super glow glass, next to the node.
